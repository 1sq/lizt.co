    <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information
      about the website itself, a unique identification number that allows the website to recognise your web browser when
      you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
    <p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user
      settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising, language).</p>
    <p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically only track
      your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called “third-party
      cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>
    <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
    <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
    <p>Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins, account management,
      shopping carts and payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our website.</p>
    <h4>Performance cookies</h4>
    <p>Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without collecting personal
      information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across all
      site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users
      may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their audience’s overall website experience. These
      cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance cookies
      on our site.</p>
    <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
    <p>Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may configure on the
      website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites can provide you with
      customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party)
      or by third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.</p>
    <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
    <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites — for example, analytics providers and content partners.
      We grant these third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They may also
      set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track
      you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no control over third-party cookies, they are
      not covered by lizt.co's cookie policy.</p>
    <h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
    <p>We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before enlisting their services to ensure their practices
      align with ours. We will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or violate the privacy of our
      users.</p>
    <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
    <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most
      browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether,
      or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie. If you browse websites from multiple devices,
      you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</p>
    <p>Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean
      you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.</p>
